For analysis secion:

When examining PERMAH scores, consider a minimum of 5 days of data. Your analysis should identify:

Clear patterns and trends in score progression
The rate of change across different PERMAH dimensions
What does this change signify
Relationships and correlations between different PERMAH elements
Areas of consistent high performance
Most improved dimensions
Growth opportunities
Breakthrough moments and their catalysts

Focus on what the recoginised pattern mean according to the PERMAH 
methadalogy and avoid responding with only the recoginised patterns
